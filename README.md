# PNG To Wav
 A tool that will generate a WAV file from a PNG (A standalone version of Serum(VST)'s import PNG).
 
 The aim of this project is to be able to retrieve a WAV file from a PNG input.
 
 Hopefully, I will be able to figure out how to map Pixel Luminance to Amplitude. This is the same formula Serum uses to import PNG files into an oscillator.
